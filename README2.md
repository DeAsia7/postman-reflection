setting up a collection and environment tabs are easy. jus add them. 
the environment section is adding the api key for your project
since we are looking for information, im using the the get method by inserting the url and the endpoints.
endpoints is what im looking for within the website. 
the json response gives everything you need by using arrays and objects
have to make sure the api key is on underneath the authorizaton tab
